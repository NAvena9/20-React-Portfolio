                    <p>
                        Hi! Iâ€™m an engineer, a team player, a full-stack software developer, with a background in customer service, OG drilling technologies and applications, with proven experience delivering client satisfaction through technical know-how and leadership.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Passionate about learning and known as a creative thinker, I got a certificate in full-stack development and I would never have thought that the conjunction of developing solutions for everyday living, solving complex problems and design-thinking were going to make me fall in love with coding. In my current role as Software QA. With my set of skills and experience I am planning on venturing to smart, automatic and integrated software systems.
                    </p>
